We have a few broad categories of games to develop, all of which will also need to be played *in the context of the larger story-line of a RPG*. It sounds like we have:

* Flash-card based games;
* Memory-card based games;
* Bingo-card based games;
* Board based games (like `Scale Snakes-and-Ladders`)

So defining each type as an abstract, into which we can feed particular datasets to customize, will allow us to *extend* the base games into custom instances.
