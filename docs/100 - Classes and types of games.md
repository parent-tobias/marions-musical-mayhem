We have a few broad categories of games to develop, all of which will also need to be played *in the context of the larger story-line of a RPG*. It sounds like we have:

* Memory-card based games (110-series);
* Flash-card based games (120-series);
* Bingo-card based games (130-series);
* Board based games (like `Scale Snakes-and-Ladders`)

So defining each type as an abstract, into which we can feed particular datasets to customize, will allow us to *extend* the base games into custom instances.

## 110 Series Games
* [[110 -  Chord Memory]]: Memory game with chord shapes/names.
* [[110 - Key Signature Match]]: Memory game with key signatures/names.

## 120 Series Games
* [[120 - Name Relay]]
* [[120 - Symbol Snap]]
* [[120 - Rhythm Race]]
* [[120 - Rhythm Relay]] - similar to above, but cooperative? I think?

## 130 Series Games
* [[130 - Musical Bingo]]

## Others, uncategorized as yet
* [[Chord Construction Challenge]]
* [[Scale Scavenger Hunt]]
* [[Scale Snakes-and-Ladders]]
